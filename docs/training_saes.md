# Training Sparse Autoencoders

Methods development for training SAEs is rapidly evolving, so these docs may change frequently. For all available training options, see [LanguageModelSAERunnerConfig][sae_lens.LanguageModelSAERunnerConfig].

However, we are attempting to maintain this [tutorial](https://github.com/jbloomAus/SAELens/blob/main/tutorials/training_a_sparse_autoencoder.ipynb)
 [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://githubtocolab.com/jbloomAus/SAELens/blob/main/tutorials/training_a_sparse_autoencoder.ipynb).

 We encourage readers to join the [Open Source Mechanistic Interpretability Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/opensourcemechanistic/shared_invite/zt-2k0id7mv8-CsIgPLmmHd03RPJmLUcapw) for support!

## Basic training setup

 Training a SAE is done using the [SAETrainingRunner][sae_lens.SAETrainingRunner] class. This class is configured using a [LanguageModelSAERunnerConfig][sae_lens.LanguageModelSAERunnerConfig], and has a single method, [run()][sae_lens.SAETrainingRunner.run], which performs training.

 Some of the core config options are below:

 - `model_name`: The base model name to train a SAE on. This must correspond to a [model from TransformerLens](https://neelnanda-io.github.io/TransformerLens/generated/model_properties_table.html).
 - `hook_name`: This is a TransformerLens hook in the model where our SAE will be trained from. More info on hooks can be found [here](https://neelnanda-io.github.io/TransformerLens/generated/demos/Main_Demo.html#Hook-Points).
 - `dataset_path`: The path to a dataset on Huggingface for training.
 - `hook_layer`: This is an int which corresponds to the layer specified in `hook_name`. This must match! e.g. if `hook_name` is `"blocks.3.hook_mlp_out"`, then `layer` must be `3`.
 - `d_in`: The input size of the SAE. This must match the size of the hook in the model where the SAE is trained.
 - `expansion_factor`: The hidden layer of the SAE will have size `expansion_factor * d_in`.
 - `l1_coefficient`: This controls how much sparsity the SAE will have after training.
 - `training_tokens`: The total tokens used for training.
 - `train_batch_size_tokens`: The batch size used for training. Adjust this to keep the GPU saturated.
 -  `model_from_pretrained_kwargs`: A dictionary of keyword arguments to pass to HookedTransformer.from_pretrained when loading the model. It's best to set "center_writing_weights" to False (this will be the default in the future).

A sample training run from the [tutorial](https://github.com/jbloomAus/SAELens/blob/main/tutorials/training_a_sparse_autoencoder.ipynb) is shown below:

```

As you can see, the training setup provides a large number of options to explore. The full list of options can be found in the [LanguageModelSAERunnerConfig][sae_lens.LanguageModelSAERunnerConfig] class.

## Logging to Weights and Biases

For any real training run, you should be logging to Weights and Biases (WandB). This will allow you to track your training progress and compare different runs. To enable WandB, set `log_to_wandb=True`. The `wandb_project` parameter in the config controls the project name in WandB. You can also control the logging frequency with `wandb_log_frequency` and `eval_every_n_wandb_logs`.

A number of helpful metrics are logged to WandB, including the sparsity of the SAE, the mean squared error (MSE) of the SAE, dead features, and explained variance. These metrics can be used to monitor the training progress and adjust the training parameters. Below is a screenshot from one training run.

![screenshot](dashboard_screenshot.png)


## Checkpoints

Checkpoints allow you to save a snapshot of the SAE and sparsitity statistics during training. To enable checkpointing, set `n_checkpoints` to a value larger than 0. If WandB logging is enabled, checkpoints will be uploaded as WandB artifacts. To save checkpoints locally, the `checkpoint_path` parameter can be set to a local directory.


## Optimizers and Schedulers

The SAE training runner uses the Adam optimizer with a constant learning rate by default. The optimizer betas can be controlled with the settings `adam_beta1` and `adam_beta2`.

The learning rate scheduler can be controlled with the `lr_scheduler_name` parameter. The available schedulers are: `constant` (default), `consineannealing`, and `cosineannealingwarmrestarts`. All schedulers can be used with linear warmup and linear decay, set via `lr_warm_up_steps` and `lr_decay_steps`.

To avoid dead features, it's often helpful to slowly increase the L1 penalty. This can be done by setting `l1_warm_up_steps` to a value larger than 0. This will linearly increase the L1 penalty over the first `l1_warm_up_steps` training steps.


## Datasets, streaming, and context size

SAELens works with datasets hosted on Huggingface. However, these datsets are often very large and take a long time and a lot of disk space to download. To speed this up, you can set `streaming=True` in the config. This will stream the dataset from Huggingface during training, which will allow training to start immediately and save disk space.

The `context_size` parameter controls the length of the prompts fed to the model. Larger context sizes will result in better SAE performance, but will also slow down training. Each training batch will be tokens of size `train_batch_size_tokens x context_size`.

It's also possible to use pre-tokenized datasets to speed up training, since tokenization can be a bottleneck. To use a pre-tokenized dataset on Huggingface, update the `dataset_path` parameter and set `is_dataset_tokenized=True` in the config.

## Pretokenizing datasets

We also provider a runner, [PretokenizeRunner][sae_lens.PretokenizeRunner], which can be used to pre-tokenize a dataset and upload it to Huggingface. See [PretokenizeRunnerConfig][sae_lens.PretokenizeRunnerConfig] for all available options. We also provide a [pretokenizing datasets tutorial](https://github.com/jbloomAus/SAELens/blob/main/tutorials/pretokenizing_datasets.ipynb) with more details.

A sample run from the tutorial for GPT2 and the NeelNanda/c4-10k dataset is shown below.

```python
from sae_lens import PretokenizeRunner, PretokenizeRunnerConfig

cfg = PretokenizeRunnerConfig(
    tokenizer_name="gpt2",
    dataset_path="NeelNanda/c4-10k", # this is just a tiny test dataset
    shuffle=True,
    num_proc=4, # increase this number depending on how many CPUs you have

    # tweak these settings depending on the model
    context_size=128,
    begin_batch_token="bos",
    begin_sequence_token=None,
    sequence_separator_token="eos",

    # uncomment to upload to huggingface
    # hf_repo_id="your-username/c4-10k-tokenized-gpt2"

    # uncomment to save the dataset locally
    # save_path="./c4-10k-tokenized-gpt2"
)

dataset = PretokenizeRunner(cfg).run()
```

## Caching activations

The next step in improving performance beyond pre-tokenizing datasets is to cache model activations. This allows you to pre-calculate all the training activations for your SAE in advance so the model does not need to be run during training to generate activations. This allows rapid training of SAEs and is especially helpful for experimenting with training hyperparameters. However, pre-calculating activations can take a very large amount of disk space, so it may not always be possible.

SAELens provides a [CacheActivationsRunner][sae_lens.CacheActivationsRunner] class to help with pre-calculating activations. See [CacheActivationsRunnerConfig][sae_lens.CacheActivationsRunnerConfig] for all available options. This runner intentionally shares a lot of options with [LanguageModelSAERunnerConfig][sae_lens.LanguageModelSAERunnerConfig]. These options should be set identically when using the cached activations in training. The CacheActivationsRunner can be used as below:

```python
from sae_lens import CacheActivationsRunner, CacheActivationsRunnerConfig

cfg = CacheActivationsRunnerConfig(
    model_name="tiny-stories-1L-21M",
    hook_name="blocks.0.hook_mlp_out",
    dataset_path="apollo-research/roneneldan-TinyStories-tokenizer-gpt2",
    # ...
    new_cached_activations_path="./tiny-stories-1L-21M-cache",
    hf_repo_id="your-username/tiny-stories-1L-21M-cache", # To push to hub
)

CacheActivationsRunner(cfg).run()
```

To use the cached activations during training, set `use_cached_activations=True` and `cached_activations_path` to match the `new_cached_activations_path` above option in training configuration.


## Uploading SAEs to Huggingface

Once you have a set of SAEs that you're happy with, your next step is to share them with the world! SAELens has a `upload_saes_to_huggingface()` function which makes this easy to do. We also provide a [uploading saes to huggingface tutorial](https://github.com/jbloomAus/SAELens/blob/main/tutorials/uploading_saes_to_huggingface.ipynb) with more details.

You'll just need to pass a dictionary of SAEs to upload along with the huggingface repo id to upload to. The dictionary keys will become the folders in the repo where each SAE will be located. It's best practice to use the hook point that the SAE was trained on as the key to make it clear to users where in the model to apply the SAE. The values of this dictionary can be either an SAE object, or a path to a saved SAE object on disk from the `sae.save_model()` method.

A sample is shown below:

```python
from sae_lens import upload_saes_to_huggingface

saes_dict = {
    "blocks.0.hook_resid_pre": layer_0_sae,
    "blocks.1.hook_resid_pre": layer_1_sae,
    # ...
}

upload_saes_to_huggingface(
    saes_dict,
    hf_repo_id="your-username/your-sae-repo",
)
```
