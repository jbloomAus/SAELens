    "5. `apply_b_dec_to_input`: Determines whether to apply the decoder bias to the input, set to True here.\n",
    "6. `finetuning_scaling_factor`: Indicates whether to use a scaling factor to weight initialization and the forward pass. This is not usually used and was introduced to support a [solution for shrinkage](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3JuSjTZyMzaSeTxKk/addressing-feature-suppression-in-saes).\n",

    "12. `prepend_bos`: Determines whether to prepend the beginning-of-sequence token, set to True.\n",
    "13. `dataset_path`: Specifies the path to the dataset used for training or evaluation. (Can be local or a huggingface dataset.)\n",
    "14. `dataset_trust_remote_code`: Indicates whether to trust remote code (from HuggingFace) when loading the dataset, set to True.\n",

    "Before we dive too deep into the various things you can do with SAEs, let's address a basic question: What is an SAE feature?\n",
    "\n",
    "An SAE feature represents a pattern or concept that the autoencoder has learned to detect in the input data. These features often correspond to meaningful semantic, syntactic, or otherwise interpretable elements of text, and correspond to linear directions in activation space. SAEs are trained on the activations of a specific part of the model, and after training, these features show up as activations in the hidden layer of the SAE (which is much wider than the source activation vector, and produces one hidden activation per feature). As such, the hidden activations represent a decomposition of the entangled/superimposed features found in the original model activations. Ideally, these activations are sparse: Only a few of the many possible hidden activations actually activate for a given piece of input. This sparseness tends to correspond to ease of interpretability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dashboard shown here provides a detailed view of a single SAE feature. (Refresh the cell to see more examples). Let's break down its components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Feature Description: At the top, we see an auto-interp-sourced description of the feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Logit Plots: The top positive and negative logits for the feature. The values indicate the strength of the association.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Activations Density Plot: This histogram shows the distribution of activation values for this feature across a randomly sampled dataset. The x-axis represents activation strength, and the y-axis shows frequency. The top chart is simply the distribution of non-zero activations, and the second plot shows the density of negative and positive logits.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Test Activation: You can use this feature within the notebook or Neuronpedia itself--simply enter text to see how the feature is activated across the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Top Activations: Below the plots, we see max-activating examples of text snippets that strongly activate this feature. Each snippet is highlighted where the activation appears.\n",

    "1. Feature Activation Distribution. We report the proportion of tokens a feature fires on, usually between 1 in every 100 and 1 in every 10,000 tokens activations, and show the distribution of positive activations.  \n",
    "2. Logit weight distribution. This is the projection of the decoder weight onto the unembed and roughly gives us a sense of the tokens promoted by a feature. It's less useful in big models / middle layers.\n",
    "3. The top 10 and bottom 10 tokens in the logit weight distribution (positive/negative logits). \n",

    "One fun (and sometimes useful) thing we can do once we've found a feature is to use it to steer a model. To do this, we find the maximum activation of a feature in a set of text (using the activation store above), use this as the default scale, multiple it by the vector representing the feature (as extracted from the decoder weights), and finally multiply this by a parameter that we control. This can be varied to see its effect on the text. Below, we'll try steering with a feature that often fires on religious or philosophical statements (feature [20115](https://www.neuronpedia.org/gpt2-small/7-res-jb/20115)). Note that sometimes steering can get GPT2 into a loop, so it's worth running this more than once."
