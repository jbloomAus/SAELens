# Overview on GPU vs Instance Types: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dlami/latest/devguide/gpu.html
# Instance Specs and Pricing: https://instances.vantage.sh/?cost_duration=daily
# g6.xlarge seems to work fine for gelu-1l, c4-tokenized-2b, 200_000 training steps, batch size 4096

# The name of your completed Cache Activation job. Must match exactly.
cache_acts_job_name: gelu_1l_500
total_training_steps: 500    # this should match or be slightly fewer than the steps in cache_acts

########################### Values that will change in the sweep 
# The values set here doesn't matter as they should be overwritten in the ./jobs/xyz.yml job files
# The point is to flag them in this section to easily see what is changed

########################### Values that stay the same in the sweep

# IMPORTANT
# YAML 1.1 spec requires scientific notation to include the decimal to be parsed as a number
# 1.0e-4 is correct and will be parsed as a number. 1e-4 is NOT correct and will be parsed as a string.
