        "Why should we expect something like this to happen? In general, the world has way more features than the model has dimensions of freedom, and so we can't have a one-to-one mapping between features and values in our model. But the model has to represent these features somehow. Hence, it comes up with techniques for cramming multiple features into fewer dimensions (at the cost of adding noise and interference between features).\n",

You should find that there are 2 types of features: ones which converge to the expected feature probability of $0.025$, and ones which quickly converge to zero.

        "    * This is a proposed architectural change which appears to increase the number of interpretable MLPs with low performance cost. In particular, it may reduce the instance of superposition.\n",
        "    * TL;DR: SOLU is an activation function $\\vec{x} \\to \\vec{x} * \\operatorname{softmax}(\\vec{x})$ which encourages sparsity in activations in the same way that softmax encourages sparsity (often softmax'ed probability distributions have one probability close to one and the others close to zero). Encouraging activation sparsity might make it harder for neurons to be polysemantic.\n",
        "    * Note that several transformers in the TransformerLens library have been trained with SOLU - see the [model page](https://neelnanda-io.github.io/TransformerLens/model_properties_table.html) for more details.\n",
